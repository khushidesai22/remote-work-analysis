One of the most significant changes in labour after the COVID-19 pandemic has been
mainstreaming remote work (Vyas, 2022). With governments creating lockdowns and
limiting movement, businesses across the globe found themselves moving to work-from-
home strategies, disrupting the standard workplace culture (Parry et al., 2022). This radical
paradigm shift has compelled economists, policy-makers, and corporate leaders to reconsider
the influence of workplace surroundings on employee performance and morale. The remote
work debate has dominated the research agendas of the labour economy and work
organisation regarding whether remote work is a productivity-enhancing or productivity-
decreasing force (Agrawal et al., 2023).
This study aims to investigate the impact of remote work on employee discontent and
productivity in a structured econometric context. The study involves real-world data on 1,000
remote workers and the implementation of statistical modelling to identify empirical trends.
The central hypothesis is that working from home is a beneficial intervention that positively
influences productivity, especially in industries where work can be carried out separately and
in knowledge-intensive industries. The research further examines the interaction of job
satisfaction factors, including feedback systems and calendar planning, with productivity in
homeworking arrangements. To analyse these relationships, the Python programming
language is used to develop an Ordinary Least Square (OLS) regression model, where the
dependent variable is productivity_score and the rest of the features are explanatory
variables, representing different behavioural and structural indicators.
